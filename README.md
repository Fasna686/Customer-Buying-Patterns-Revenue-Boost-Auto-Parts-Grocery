# Customer-Buying-Patterns-Revenue-Boost-Auto-Parts-Grocery
 **Marketing &amp; Retail Analytics**



**Timeline:** June 2024  
**Course:** Marketing & Retail Analytics

### Project Overview

This project is divided into two distinct parts, each focusing on a different industry: automobile parts manufacturing and grocery retail. The goal of both parts is to leverage data science techniques to uncover actionable insights that drive customer engagement and revenue growth.

#### **Part A: Automobile Parts Manufacturing**

**Objective:**  
The aim is to analyze three years of transaction data for an automobile parts manufacturing company. With no in-house data science team, the company has sought external expertise to reveal hidden buying patterns among its customers. The task is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies tailored to each segment. This will help the company optimize its marketing efforts and better meet customer needs.

**Problem Statement:**  
The company has accumulated a wealth of transaction data over three years but lacks the internal resources to extract value from it. As a consultant, your job is to apply data science techniques to identify customer segments and their unique buying patterns. The insights gained will inform the development of customized marketing strategies, ultimately aiming to enhance customer retention and increase sales.

#### **Part B: Grocery Retail Analysis**

**Objective:**  
The second part of the project focuses on analyzing Point of Sale (POS) data from a grocery store. The goal is to identify common sets of items that are frequently purchased together. Based on these patterns, you will recommend combo offers and discounts that can boost the store's revenue by encouraging customers to buy more.

**Problem Statement:**  
The grocery store has provided transactional data and seeks to understand the most popular item combinations among its customers. Your task is to conduct a thorough analysis of this data, uncovering frequent item sets and suggesting lucrative combo offers and discounts. These recommendations aim to enhance the store's sales performance by increasing the average transaction value.

### **Skills & Tools Covered**
- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To understand the data and uncover key patterns and trends.
- **KNIME:** For data processing and model building without coding.
- **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis:** To segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** To identify frequently purchased item combinations and suggest effective product bundling strategies.
